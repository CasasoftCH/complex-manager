<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.</p>

<h2>Shortcodes</h2>

<p>To make things easy to fill your page with custom content, the plugin utilizes shortcodes to render the offers.</p>

<h2>functions</h2>

<p>with <code>get_cxm($post_id, $field);</code> and <code>get_cxm_label($post_id, $field);</code></p>

<p>You can retrieve data from the registered post types &ldquo;complex_unit&rdquo; and &ldquo;complex_inquiry&rdquo;. This allows you to create custom views/templates of the archive and single pages</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>This plugin was developed for the following css environments</p>

<ul>
<li>The template utilizes the twitter bootstrap v3 framework</li>
<li>You have control of the template and are willing to add the necesarry css to the template to make it look good :-)</li>
</ul>


<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>Although the plugin will run without javascript, some of the features, such as the &ldquo;Kontakt&rdquo; button work differently with javascript turned off. Ensure that you have implemented the wp_head and wp_foot functions within your theme where appropriate.
A single javascript will be included within the front-end.</p>
